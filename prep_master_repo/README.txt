I. Description:

This repository and guide is to direct an engineer with prior development experience to important resources in 
preparing for a Golang interview. It is designed to make effective use of time and assumes that there is a week 
or less to prepare. There are recommended time frames for completing tasks. 

II. Interview Preparation Schedule: 

Day 1: 

Install Go and Documentation point of reference: https://go.dev/ 

This site introduces syntax in Go: Tour of Go: https://go.dev/tour/welcome/
Move at a decent pace up to Generics&Concurrency and do not spend too long on any section. 
The most important sections are 'Flow Control Statements (ignore the 'switch' and 'defer' sections)' and 'More Types'. (1-2 hrs)

Complete 1-2 starter_prompts. (1hr) 

Day 2: 

Watch the following videos: 

Slices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnBKdUu1Q0U
Structs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPX6ORiyd0o
Maps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Q8n3LlMOY
Pointers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOz_Xu5WanQ

Finish starter_prompts. Look up help needed for syntax. (2-3hrs)

Day 3:

Complete a few intermediate_prompts. (2-3hrs)

Do your best to look things up less. 

Day 4: 

Complete the Banking Kata. (2-3hrs)

Make sure to pay attention to time: 
starter_prompts should take 15min, while intermediate_prompts should be completed in 30-45min.

Complete 1-2 intermediate_prompts (30-90min) 


Day 5: 

Review previous coding exercises & materials. (30-45min)

Warmup for a mock interview by doing 1 or 2 starter_prompts. (30min)

Complete a mock interview (timed session with 1 starter & 1 intermediate prompt or 1 kata). (1hr)

Day 6 (Bonus):

Complete a kata mock interview. (1hr)

A katas based question will be more open ended compared to the prompts completed earlier this week.
It could show up in a form similar to the banking kata completed on day 4. Solutions to these do not have to be super thorough, a good solution will provide an initial approach to solving the open ended prompt.  

Review section 6 (15min). 


III. Starter Prompts:

For an engineer with prior experience, each question in this section should be easy to solve (leetcode easys). 
The challenge will be to learn the syntax quickly and to the point where you will not need to look anything up.
Each question should take around 15 minutes to solve. Questions provided are from https://codesignal.com/ & https://leetcode.com/. 
For each question, description.txt contains the prompt, what the prompt is testing, & source link while example_solution contains my brute force solution for reference. 


IV. Next Prompts:

These prompts are more advanced (leetcode mediums) and should take 30-45min to solve,
especially when working towards a more efficient solution. 


V. Important Katas: 

Katas are more open ended questions that allow you to demonstrate mastery of several different pieces 
of a given language. The problems are from https://kata-log.rocks/. 
An interview question similar to a katas prompt will be more open ended. 


VI. Good to Know:

Quick Facts: 

1. Golang is a typed language.
2. Go was created in 2009 and is centered around performance, simplicity, and concurrency. 
3. Go has a built in garbage collection mechanism that auto allocates memory. You do not have to worry about garbage collection in Go. 
4. Goroutines and channels allow you to build programs supporting Concurrency.
