I Description:

This repository and guide is to direct an engineer with prior development experience to important resources in 
preparing for a Golang interview. It is designed to make effective use of time and assumes that there is a week 
or less to prepare. There are recommended time frames for completing tasks. 


II Outline: 

Day 1: 

Install Go and Documentation point of reference: https://go.dev/ 

Tour of Go: https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1 

Move at a decent pace up to Generics&Concurrency and do not spend too long on any section. 
This site helps introduce you to basic syntax in Go. 

Most important sections are 'Flow Control Statements' and 'More Types'. (1-2 hrs)

Complete 1-2 starter_prompts. (1hr) 

Day 2: 

Finish starter_prompts. Look up help needed for syntax. (2-3hrs)
If you complete these prompts early, review material studied thus far or review section 6. 

Day 3:

Complete a few next_prompts. (2-3hrs)

Being focusing on syntax heavily and do your best to look things up less. 

Day 4: 

Complete the Banking Kata. (2-3hrs)

For future prompts, make sure to pay attention to time: 
starter_prompts should take 15-20min, while next_prompts should be completed in 30-45min.

Complete 1-2 next_prompts (30-60min) 


Day 5: 

Review previous coding & materials. Review areas of weakness in syntax. (30-45min)

Warmup for a mock interview by doing 1 or 2 starter_prompts. (30min)

Complete a mock interview. (1hr)

This interview should have 1 starter_prompts and 1 next_prompts. Mock interviews are provided in mock_interviews. 

You should time yourself. If possible, have an interviewer.  


Day 6 (Bonus):

If you have an extra day/time, complete an additional mock interview through solving a kata. (1hr)

A katas based question will be more open ended compared to the prompts completed earlier this week.
It could show up in a form similar to the banking kata completed on day 4. 

Example kata mocks are provided in kata_mocks.

Review section 6 (15min). 


III Starter Prompts:

For an engineer with prior experience, each question in this section should be easy to solve. 
The challenge will be to learn the syntax quickly and to the point where you will not need to look anything up.
Each question should take 15-20 minutes to solve. Questions are from https://codesignal.com/ & https://leetcode.com/. 
Each question will have a short description of what the problem is testing. 


IV Next Prompts:

These prompts are more advanced and should take 30-45min to solve, especially when working towards a more efficient solution. 
For those familiar with leetcode, problems are of the medium difficulty. Short descriptions are again provided for each prompt. 

V Important Katas: 

Katas are more open ended questions that allow you to demonstrate mastery of several different pieces of a given language.
The problems referenced below are from https://kata-log.rocks/. An interview question similar to katas will test your understanding of different pieces but will likely look different.


VI Good to Know:

Below are important quick facts about Go that you should be aware of before an interview:
