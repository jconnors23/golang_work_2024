Simulate an elevator software system
starting with simple behaviors and working toward complex ones. 
Assume good input from calling code and concentrate on the main flow.

Here are some suggested lift features:

a lift responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
a lift has an attribute floor, which describes itâ€™s current location
a lift delivers passengers to requested floors
Queue system for elevator
Distance logic for traveling to different floors
you may implement current floor monitor
you may implement direction arrows
you may implement doors (opening and closing)
you may implement DING!
there can be more than one lift
